1.  Introduction

   The Attribution API [ATTR] is a web platform feature that provides
   sites that use advertising with the ability to measure the
   effectiveness of that advertising.  Measurements that the API produce
   are aggregated using the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP)
   [DAP].

   This document defines extensions to DAP that support the use of DAP
   by the Attribution API.  These extensions fall into two categories:

   *  Support for the differential privacy model used in the Attribution
      API.

   *  Support for the operational modes that better fit the deployment
      model that the Attribution API uses.

   These extensions are not narrowly defined such that they can only be
   used by the Attribution API.  Other applications might be able to use
   them, but any effort to make them fully generic stops short of making
   the extensions more complex that is required for Attribution.

   For example, privacy budget extensions are defined to use the epsilon
   definition from (ε, 0)-differential privacy or (ε, δ)-differential
   privacy with a fixed δ value.  This is simpler than a design that
   might allow for multiple budget metrics.

   These extensions all assume the use of DAP task provisioning
   [TASKPROV].  However, only the collector identity extension
   (Section 6) concretely depends on [TASKPROV], as it uses the task
   configuration extensions.  All other extensions apply to the core DAP
   protocol [DAP].

1.1.  Differential Privacy in Attribution

   The Attribution API provides information to websites based on user
   activity on other websites, which is ordinarily prohibited for
   privacy reasons [WEB-PRIV].

   To protect privacy, the Attribution API uses differential privacy
   [DP] in a combination of the central and individual models [ATTR-DP].
   The privacy architecture of the Attribution API allocates
   responsibility for managing sensitivity and privacy budgets to
   browser instances (DAP Clients) and for the addition of noise to an
   aggregation service (DAP Aggregators, collectively).

   To this end, reports that are submitted for aggregation need to be
   bound to the privacy budget that was expended at a Client when the
   report was generated.  This ensures that Aggregators can apply noise
   with sufficient amplitude to maintain the intended differential
   privacy guarantee.

   An extension that reports the amount of privacy budget that was
   consumed in the generation of a report is described in Section 3.

1.2.  Attribution Operating Mode Extensions

   The Attribution API is expected to operate in a mode that differs
   somewhat from the way that DAP is architected.  Several extensions
   are defined to support this operating mode.

   In DAP, a task is a long-running context that Clients continuously
   contribute to.  Reports are directly uploaded by Clients to the
   Leader as they are generated.  The DAP batch mode determines how
   reports are grouped for aggregation.  A new collection job is
   initiated by the Collector when an aggregate is needed, though this
   might fail if the requirements for the task -- the batch mode and
   minimum batch size, primary -- are not met.

   A simple representation of the DAP architecture is illustrated in
   Figure 1.

                                             Result

                   Figure 1: Simplified DAP Architecture

   In the Attribution API, reports are delivered to the website that
   requests them.  The site is expected to gather a bundle of reports
   and submit them for aggregation when they have a sufficiently large
   set.

   An important feature of this design is that the website (as a DAP
   Collector) chooses which reports to aggregate.  This gives the site
   an opportunity to review the circumstances in which reports were
   generated and filter reports according to their needs.

   A secondary reason for Clients to deliver reports to the website,
   rather than submit them directly to the Leader, is that this removes
   a real-time dependency on the Leader.  A Leader can therefore be less
   available than the sites that depend on its services.

   A simple representation of the architecture used by the Attribution
   API is illustrated in Figure 2.

                                                            +--------+
                                                            | Helper |

                                                                ^

                                               Result

                Figure 2: Attribution API Architecture

   To support this mode of operation, a new batch mode for DAP is
   defined called "collector-selected"; see Section 4.  For other batch
   modes, the Leader has sufficient information to select reports for
   inclusion in a collection job.  In comparison, this batch mode
   requires that reports carry an annotation set by the Collector at the
   time that each report is uploaded.

1.3.  Other Extensions

   Three other extensions are defined in this document.

   The minimum privacy budget collection job extension (Section 5) added
   to collection job initialization places guardrails around what
   reports can be included in a collection job.  Reports that lack a
   privacy budget extension or those with a value below the indicated
   threshold must be rejected by Aggregators.

   For the Attribution API, setting a minimum privacy budget is roughly
   equivalent to capping the noise that is added to an aggregate.
   Without this extension, noise could be determined from the privacy
   budget values bound to each report.  This ensures that reports that
   do not match expectations can be dropped efficiently, rather than
   having Aggregators add unexpectedly large amounts of noise.

   The collector identity task extension (Section 6) binds the identity
   of the Collector to tasks.  This extension fixes the entity can
   request collection of reports.

   In the Attribution API, the Collector is either a "conversion site",
   or an "internediary site"; see [ATTR].  The conversion site is the
   top-level site where reports are generated.  An intermediary site is
   any entity that operates independently from the top-level site, and
   it includes the providers of resources (such as images or other
   content) and framed content (that is, HTML iframes).

   The budget source task extension (Section 7) binds the identity of
   the context that provides privacy budget to tasks.  This extension
   ensures that reports that draw from different privacy budgets cannot
   be aggregated together.

   For the Attribution API, each "conversion site" receives their own
   source of privacy budget.  Binding tasks to their identity ensures
   that the privacy guarantees associated with that privacy budget hold
   when Aggregators are responsible for adding noise.  That is, reports
   that draw from different budgets cannot be aggregated together with a
   single quantity of noise.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document relies on the definitions in DAP [DAP] for protocol
   roles and functions.  Some reference is made to the terms and
   concepts in the Attribution API [ATTR], though familiarity with these
   should not be necessary to understand how the extensions interact
   with DAP.

3.  Differential Privacy Budget Report Extension

   The privacy budget report extension (codepoint 0xTBD) encodes the
   amount of privacy budget that might have been expended by a Client as
   a result of producing a report.

   The value of the codepoint is an integer encoding of the number of
   micro-epsilons of budget that are expended.  That is, each unit is a
   one-millionth of an epsilon (ε) as used in (ε, δ)-differential
   privacy.

   The micro-epsilon value is encoded as a 32-bit integer in network
   byte order.  This permits expenditure of up to ε=4294.967295 to be
   encoded.

   The delta (δ) parameter is not directly bound to reports.  This
   parameter is rarely used in privacy budgeting.  A maximum value for δ
   might be fixed as part of the configuration in a specific deployment.
   Setting a value for δ is necessary when selecting a differential
   privacy mechanism.  In setting a value for δ, a deployment needs to
   consider the total report volume and the total number of tasks that
   each client might contribute to.

      |  Note: Where the delta (δ) value is non-zero, and a client might
      |  generate many reports, clients might also need to limit the
      |  number of reports to prevent the overall delta value from
      |  growing large.

3.1.  Privacy Budgeting

   A privacy budget ensures that the total information release can be
   bounded while providing more flexibility to the recipients of the
   noisy results.  Recipients are able to adjust how budget is used to
   control how noise is distributed across multiple information
   releases.

   The amount of noise added to aggregates is based on the expended
   budget.  In general, spending more privacy budget means that less
   noise is needed to maintain the same level of privacy; conversely,
   spending less budget means more noise.

   A budget might be specified in terms of a metric (like the epsilon
   parameter in (ε, δ)-differential privacy) that is expended with each
   information release.  As noted, this extension uses the ε metric.

   For example, for an overall budget of ε=10 might be split four ways:
   (0.5, 1.5, 2, 6).  Noise might then be added, drawing from a
   distribution with a width inversely proportional to the budget spent;
   that is, a distribution with a standard deviation proportional to 2,
   2/3, 1/2, and 1/6 respectively.

3.2.  Applicability to Differential Privacy Models

   When used in the Attribution API, the privacy budget report extension
   does not always encode the exact amount of privacy budget that was
   expended.  The individual DP model used in Attribution (see
   [ATTR-DP]), allows a Client to expend less of its budget than this
   value for several reasons.

   This introduces some complexity, because any reduction in the budget
   spent is based on private information.  Consequently, any reduced
   expenditure needs to be kept secret.  In that setting, the extension
   reports the maximum possible expenditure.

   This extension gives users of the Attribution API the ability to
   manage privacy budget expenditure on a per-report basis.

   By binding the amount of budget spent to each report, the Client can
   transfer responsibility for applying noise to Aggregators.  The
   addition of noise in the one place can ensure a better trade-off
   between the amount of added noise and privacy parameters.

   The Attribution API differs from some other uses of DAP. which
   instead involve Clients adding noise to reports at the time they are
   generated.  To maintain the usefulness of aggregates, the amount of
   noise added by each Client is kept low.  To maintain strong privacy,
   Clients partly rely on DAP mixing their contributions with the
   contributions of other Clients, following the shuffle DP approach
   [SHUFFLE].  Such uses depend on attaining a certain minimum batch
   size in order to meet their differential privacy targets.

   Applying noise during aggregation reduces the importance of the
   minimum batch size parameter in task configuration.  However, it adds
   to the work that Clients need to trust Aggregators to perform.

   To maintain consistency with the DAP threat model for privacy (see
   Section 8 of [DAP]), this can mean either performing noise addition
   in an MPC protocol or having Aggregators each independently apply the
   requisite amount of noise.

   A number of MPC protocols for adding noise exist, but these are often
   not efficient in the two-party setting relative to the VDAF protocols
   typically used.  On the other hand, the redundant addition of noise
   by Aggregators results in more noise when both Aggregators are
   honest.  Even so, adding two amounts of noise often results in less
   overall noise than other approaches.

4.  Collector-Selected Batch Mode

   The collector-selected batch mode (codepoint 0xTBD) give the
   Collector control over which reports are included in collection job.

   In this batch mode the Leader is not able to determine the associated
   batch for a report based on the contents of each report alone.  This
   differs from the existing leader-selected (Section 5.2 of [DAP]) or
   time interval (Section 5.1 of [DAP]) batch modes.

   To that end, uploads of reports use a different URL template from the
   usual location for report uploads; see Section 4.1.

   This arrangement prevents the Leader from accepting reports until a
   collection job is created.  A Leader MAY accept hold requests to
   upload reports for a short period prior to the creation of a
   collection job.  Accepting reports would be on the expectation that a
   request to create the indicated collection job is imminent or still
   being processed, so it could reduce latency.

   However, the Leader MUST limit the reports it accepts prior to
   accepting the corresponding collection job.  Without a limit, the
   Leader gives malicious actors the unrestricted capability to exhaust
   its resources.

   A Leader that does not accept reports MUST reject the request, and
   can respond with an indication to try later.  This response could use
   a 404 status code and the Retry-After response field; see Sections
   15.5.5 and 10.2.3 of [HTTP].

      |  Where a collection job already exists, the high entropy
      |  collection job ID in the URL could make it unnecessary to
      |  require authentication of upload requests for this batch mode;
      |  see [CAP-URL].  This is not the case if reports are accepted
      |  without confirming the existence of the identified collection
      |  job.

   A Leader MUST reject attempts to upload reports to the regular report
   upload resource (as defined in Section 4.5.2 of [DAP]) when the
   collector-selected batch mode is configured for a task.

4.1.  Report Upload URL Template

   Reports in the collector-selected batch mode are uploaded to a URL
   that follows the template:

   {leader}/tasks/{task-id}/reports/{collection-job-id}

   The inclusion of the collection job ID (see Section 4.7 of [DAP])
   differs from other batch modes where the Collector does not need to
   provide any additional information to a Leader.

4.2.  Batch Mode Parameters

   This batch mode uses the same parameters as the leader-selected batch
   mode (Section 5.2 of [DAP]).  That is, the payload Query.config is
   empty.  Both the PartialBatchSelector.config and the
   BatchSelector.config contains a batch ID that is assigned by the
   Leader.

5.  Minimum Privacy Budget Collection Job Extension

   The minimum privacy budget collection job extension (codepoint 0xTBD)
   allows a Collector to inform Aggregators of a minimum value for the
   privacy budget report extension (see Section 3) that it expects to be
   included in the collection job.

   The format of this extension is a 32-bit network-endian encoding of
   an integer in units of micro-epsilon.  This is identical to the
   format of the privacy budget report extension (Section 3).

   This extension is defined primarily as a safeguard.  In the absence
   of this extension, Aggregators could determine the amount of privacy
   budget that was expended by every report and generate noise based on
   the minimum value across all reports.

   That approach is potentially error prone.  If a Collector
   accidentally includes a report with a much lower budget, the
   Aggregate it receives would have more noise added than expected.  The
   collection job extension effectively sets a cap on the noise that
   might be added.

   Aggregators can use this extension in one of two ways:

   *  The value in the collection job extension directly determines the
      magnitude of the noise that is added to the aggregate.

   *  The value is only used to filter reports and the minimum value of
      the privacy budget report extension across all accepted reports
      determines the magnitude of added noise.

   The latter provides for lower noise in the case that the Collector
   provides a low value, but is more complex to implement.  There is
   also no way provided to indicate to the Collector that less noise was
   added than they might have planned.

6.  Collector Identity Task Extension

   TODO: Update this to refer to DAP proper.

   The collector identity task extension [TASKPROV] (codepoint 0xTBD)
   binds the task -- and all reports submitted to that task -- to a
   single Collector.

   This extension does not specify how to encode the identity of the
   Collector.  Different uses of DAP can choose an encoding that best
   suits the situation.

   The Attribution API has its own understanding of how to encode the
   identity of the Collector.  The value is a UTF-8-encoded string of
   the registrable domain from the intermediary site tuple (if there is
   an intermediary site) or the conversion site tuple (where there is no
   intermediary site).

6.1.  Collector Identity and HPKE Configuration

   Regardless of how the Collector is identified, if an identity is
   included, the Leader and Helper MUST have a process for validating
   the HPKE configuration they use to encrypt aggregate shares for the
   Collector.

   That process MUST provide confirmation that the identified entity
   authorizes the HPKE configuration.  This does not depend on active
   proof of possession for the corresponding private key [SIGMA] but
   rather an affirmation that the public key is approved by the
   identified entity.

   One option for Collector identification is to use a URL, following
   the pattern used for the Leader and Helper (TODO: DAP citation).  If
   the URL uses an authenticated protocol, such as HTTP with the "https"
   scheme [RFC9110], retrieving an HPKE configuration from that URL (or
   similarly authenticated resources that are referenced from the
   response) provides the necessary authorization for the included key.

   The Attribution API does not define a process for authorizing a
   Collector HPKE configuration based on the encoded Collector identity.

7.  Budget Source Task Extension

   TODO: Update this to refer to DAP proper.

   The budget source task extension [TASKPROV] (codepoint 0xTBD) binds
   the task -- and all reports submitted to that task -- to a single
   source of privacy budget.

   This extension does not specify how to encode the identity of this
   entity.  Different uses of DAP can choose an encoding that best suits
   the needs of the differentially private usage.

   The Attribution API has its own understanding of how to encode the
   identity of the budget source.  The value is a UTF-8-encoded string
   of the registrable domain from the conversion site tuple.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security factors specific to each extension are covered in the
   respective sections.

   Use of DAP is subject to the security considerations of DAP
   (Section 8 of [DAP]) and the VDAF that is in use (Section 9 of
   [VDAF].

9.  IANA Considerations

   TODO - update this for the collection job extension. ...and the
   change in where task configuration is likely to go.

Acknowledgments

   Roxana Geambesu noted that a binding to site identity (Section 6) was
   an important component of a robust differential privacy system design
   for the Attribution API.  David Cook provided useful feedback about
   the design and document.  Chris Patton provided helpful input on how
   to integrate with the DAP architecture.
